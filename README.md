## Develop

it is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

### Posts

* The **Staff Author** field links to members in the **Staff** collection.
* Documentation pages are organised in the navigation by category, with URLs based on the path inside the `_docs` folder.
