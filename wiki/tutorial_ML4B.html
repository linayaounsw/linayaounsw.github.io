                                    <h3>Supervised Machine Learning</h3>

                                    <p>In supervised learning, the ultimate goal is the find out the perfect function
                                        (called
                                        hypothesis in machine learning) can calculate the result based on given data.
                                        The
                                        “learning” is normally a sophisticated mathematical calculation process for find
                                        the
                                        best parameters of the hypothesis function. Supervised learning also can divide
                                        into
                                        classification and regression process. Classification means samples belong to
                                        two or
                                        more classes and we want to learn from already labeled data how to predict the
                                        class of
                                        unlabeled data. An example of classification problem would be the handwritten
                                        digit
                                        recognition example, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a
                                        finite
                                        number of discrete categories. Regression means if the desired output consists
                                        of one or
                                        more continuous variables, then the task is called regression. An example of a
                                        regression problem would be the prediction of the length of a salmon as a
                                        function of
                                        its age and weight.</p>

                                    <h5>Define Problem</h5>

                                    <p>In general, a learning problem considers a set of n samples of data and then
                                        tries to
                                        predict properties of unknown data. If each sample is more than a single number
                                        and, for
                                        instance, a multi-dimensional entry (aka multivariate data), it is said to have
                                        several
                                        attributes or features. Machine learning is about learning some properties of a
                                        data set
                                        and applying them to new data. This is why a common practice in machine learning
                                        to
                                        evaluate an algorithm is to split the data at hand into two sets, one that we
                                        call the
                                        training set on which we learn data properties and one that we call the testing
                                        set on
                                        which we test these properties.</p>

                                    <h5>Prepare Data</h5>

                                    <p>The Iris flower data set or Fisher’s Iris data set is a multivariate data set
                                        introduced
                                        by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic
                                        problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called
                                        Anderson’s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify
                                        the
                                        morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.Two of the three
                                        species
                                        were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula “all from the same pasture, and picked on
                                        the same
                                        day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same
                                        apparatus”.4</p>

                                    <p>Firstly, we start a python interpreter to load the iris dataset.</p>

                                        help
                                        engineers and scientists build, implement, and maintain production machine
                                        learning
                                        systems efficiently and easily. As a scientist, If we want to been able to see
                                        further,
                                        it was only because we stood on the shoulders of giants. Let’s build great
                                        machine
                                        learning algorithms base on the existing excellent libraries. There are also
                                        some other
                                        machine learning libraries can be found:</p>

                                            playing around to get a feel for what is possible with machine learning.
